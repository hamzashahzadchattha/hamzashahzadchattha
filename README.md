## 🚀 What I'm All About

I'm that engineer who gets excited about shaving milliseconds off API response times and architecting systems that scale effortlessly. I don't just write code—I craft digital experiences that handle real-world chaos with grace.

When I'm not deep in AWS documentation or optimizing database queries, you'll find me building stuff that actually matters: healthcare platforms connecting patients with doctors, AI-powered creative tools, or making educational resources lightning-fast for thousands of users.

**My superpower?** Taking a complex mess of requirements and transforming them into clean, serverless architectures that just work. I've built production systems from absolute zero—no templates, no hand-holding, just pure engineering.

### 💡 What Gets Me Out of Bed

- 🏗️ **Building from Scratch**: Give me a blank canvas and watch me create magic.
- ⚡ **Performance Junkie**: N+1 queries? Not on my watch. I hunt down bottlenecks like a detective
- 🎯 **Real Impact**: My optimizations serve thousands of real users daily, making their lives easier
- 🧠 **Problem Crusher**: Love those "impossible" challenges that make others nervous

## 🎯 Projects I'm Proud Of

### 🏥 eShaafi - Healthcare Revolution
**[Live App](https://www.eshaafi.com/) | [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eshaafi.patient.consultation&hl=en&pli=1)**

Remember when I said I build from scratch? This is THE proof. Created an entire telehealth platform that connects patients and doctors in real-time. We're talking video consultations, smart appointment scheduling, instant notifications—the whole nine yards.

**The Cool Stuff:**
- 🎥 Video calls that actually work (thanks Agora.io!)
- 🔔 Push notifications that don't annoy people
- 🤖 Smart scheduling using AWS Step Functions
- 📱 Works seamlessly on iOS, Android, and Web
- ⚡ Serverless architecture that scales like crazy

**My favorite part?** Built a unified API that handles all three platforms. One codebase, infinite scalability. That's the dream right there.

### 🎨 Aspire AI - Where Creativity Meets Code
**[Website](https://aspire.pics/) | [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=aspire%20ai&c=apps&hl=en)**

An AI-powered social platform where people generate stunning images from text prompts. Think Instagram meets DALL-E, but with a backend that doesn't break a sweat.

**What Makes It Special:**
- 🤖 AI image generation that feels magical
- 💨 Lightning-fast feed (because nobody likes waiting)
- 🔥 Redis caching that makes everything snappy
- 👥 Full social features: posts, followers, comments, likes
- 🎯 Smart feed algorithm that shows you what you want

**Achievement unlocked:** Cut API response times in half with strategic caching. Users noticed, engagement shot up.

### 📚 Times Course Finder - The Optimization Story
**[Live Site](https://timescoursefinder.com/)**

Took the largest course search platform and made it 30-40% faster. Yeah, you read that right—almost HALF the time.

**How'd I do it?**
- 🚀 Redis caching on every endpoint that mattered
- 🔧 Raw SQL queries to eliminate ORM bloat
- ⚡ Celery for background processing
- 📊 Denormalized lookup tables for instant searches

**Result?** Thousands of students finding courses faster than ever. That's what good engineering looks like.
